Palestinians want to bomb Israelis that force them at gunpoint to live in restricted parts of the country. Arab leaders are furious about this situation and want Israelis, &#39;wiped off the map&#39; and their land given back to Palestinians, even though the real estate of the Holy Land looks something like rural Utah. And nearly all the world&#39;s leaders see fit to chime in on this dispute over the two tiny lands.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo untangle the modern Middle East conflict and the 2,000 years behind it, this book is divided into 25 concise chapters. Each one is devoted to a major theme in Middle East history, such as the beginning of Islam, the Crusades, Genghis Khan, and the beginning of Israel in 1948. They can be read in a few minutes, giving you a fast overview of the issues and help you to understand Middle East current events.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the end you will know as much about Middle East history and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as you would after a year-long college course. You will also sound highly knowledgeable about world affairs to your friends and associates.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you want to understand this part of the world completely in as short a time as possible, then From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa is for you!","wikiImage":"https:\/\/whatimg.com\/i\/0Xs3Fq.jpg","id":72812826,"name":"Michael Rank - From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa: A Crash Course in 2,000 Years of Middle East History","year":2013,"recordLabel":"","catalogueNumber":"","releaseType":0,"categoryId":4,"categoryName":"Audiobooks","time":"2014-10-16 23:13:19","vanityHouse":false,"isBookmarked":false,"musicInfo":null,"tags":["non.fiction"]},"torrent":{"id":31720450,"infoHash":"340E8A03090A1C28AB563D605D9734FC4BF3D27A","media":"","format":"AAC","encoding":"38 (VBR)","remastered":false,"remasterYear":0,"remasterTitle":"","remasterRecordLabel":"","remasterCatalogueNumber":"","scene":false,"hasLog":false,"hasCue":false,"logScore":0,"fileCount":1,"size":35465695,"seeders":1,"leechers":0,"snatched":0,"freeTorrent":false,"reported":false,"time":"2014-10-16 23:13:19","description":"","fileList":"Michael Rank - From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa (Unabridged).m4a{{{35465695}}}","filePath":"Michael Rank - From Muhammed to Burj Khalifa (Unabridged)","userId":420135,"username":"fakonbutty"}}}
